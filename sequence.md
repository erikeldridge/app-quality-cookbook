# A suggested reading sequence

In the spirit of iteration, I recommend introducing core concepts and then building up.

## 1

1. [preface](preface.md) tldr and goals
1. Drawing exercises 1, 2, and 3

* How do you know if the shape is drawn correctly?
* If we don't get feedback, how do we know if we've drawn a shape correctly?
* Was it easier to draw the shape correctly with feedback?

## 2

1. [preface](preface.md) bias toward scope over quality wrt solo development
1. [Unix intro](tools/unix.md)
1. [Unix fs and ssh exercise](](exercises/unix.md))

1. [Testing theory 1](testing/README.md)
1. [Version control intro](version_control/README.md)
1. [Git intro](tools/git.md)
1. [Java exercise 2](exercises/java.md)

Concepts:
* How efficiently can we write code with a simple text editor?
* How confident are we in code written in a text editor?
* Does running code through a compiler help improve confidence?
